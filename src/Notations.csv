"{pattern}","A pattern is one or more branches, separated by ""\|"".  It matches anything that matches one of the branches. A branch is one or more concats, separated by ""\&"".  It matches the last concat, but only if all the preceding concats also match at the same position. A concat is one or more pieces, concatenated.  It matches a match for the first piece, followed by a match for the second piece, etc. A piece is an atom, possibly followed by a multi, an indication of how many times the atom can be matched. An atom can be one of a long list of items.  Many atoms match one character in the text.  It is often an ordinary character or a character class. Braces can be used to make a pattern into an atom."
"{file}","Note for systems other than Unix: When using a command that accepts a single file name (like "":edit file"") spaces in the file name are allowed, but trailing spaces are ignored.  This is useful on systems that regularly embed spaces in file names (like MS-Windows and the Amiga).  Example: The command "":e   Long File Name "" will edit the file ""Long File Name"".  When using a command that accepts more than one file name (like "":next file1 file2"") embedded spaces must be escaped with a backslash."
